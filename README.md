# Emojification
This is a deep-learning project which I developed while learning the fundamental concepts Deep Learning

Dataset: 
1. Taken from Kaggle (I don't have the exact url but will update soon).
2. Emojis taken from Dataflair website.

  NOTE:
  This project is still under development so do not try to implement them.
